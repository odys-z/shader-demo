# shader-demo

This is a temp repo for testing. No plan to support in the future.

The shadertoy and raymatching is some how different from the well known style, see [2].

This repository is a testing project using three.js for running shaders from shadertoy
in a html file, independent to shadertoy.

Here are some of the results:

- basic raymatching shape

![basic raymatching](https://github.com/odys-z/odys-z.github.io/blob/master/notes/opnGL/raymatching/screenshots/000%20basix.png "basic raymatching screenshot")

Try the different algorithms in [3].

- platonic solids

![platonic solids](https://github.com/odys-z/odys-z.github.io/blob/master/notes/opnGL/raymatching/screenshots/004%20Platonic%20solid.png "platonic solid screenshot")

Shapes melding, because of power of "mix()".
